1,Gets very creepy when it turns out that this is how the family continues;  they've been doing this for generations .
1,"And then at the very end of the episode, it turns out that the family has other branches, and the last shot of the episode is another similar set (mother, father and young son) preparing to kill some other people."
1,"""Open Season"" had brothers  who hunted people for sport , having been taught to so by their uncle, a paranoid psychotic who had died some time before the events of the episode."
1,"; the couple treated him sort of like a son, and he even helped them abduct other kids) and ""A Thousand Words"" (a near example because the father committed suicide, and   the mother dies giving birth to their son ."

0,Apparently a lot of criminals on this show have a foot fetish.
1,"Syd's especially, since she's the leader of the two and all but one of the attacks happen in places that remind her of her dad ."
1,"In ""Epilogue,"" the Unsub   resuscitates his victims so he can find out what they saw and compare it to his own  Near Death Experience ."
1,"During the investigation, Reid reveals that he saw a bright light before   Tobias Hankel resuscitated him ; but the trope is subverted for Prentiss, who counters that she flatlined in the ambulance after   being impaled by Doyle  and only felt cold and darkness."
0,"Hotch (Bad Cop) and Prentiss (Good Cop) do a fairly spectacular version in ""Bloodlines."
0,"Subverted by   Emily Prentiss, FBI agent who had an abortion at fifteen and is never shown to have angst over it."
1,"She is never once shown to have been ""punished"" or seen as ""bad"" because of her abortion."
1,"Also subverted in the episode ""The Crossing"":   it's revealed at one point that a stalking victim had an abortion, but although this causes some problems between her and her boyfriend, it's not connected in any way to the stalking and her abduction is not positioned as narrative punishment for having it."
1,"The episode also subtly implies, entirely non-judgmentally, that newly-pregnant JJ has been considering an abortion up until the point where she calls her boyfriend in the final scene ."
1,"By the grace of God, he   stared down the original bomber ; by the disgrace of God, he   did not get to appear in TV like other survivors did; in fact they not only claimed one of  them  did it, they didn't even  remember  him, if they knew who he  was  in the first place."
1,"Worse is that the title refers to the fact that, because of the injuries he incurred from the explosion, he can no longer feel any pain due to brain damage, and is the only one who has any kind of long-term injury like that, so he suffered more than the rest too ."
1,"We find out that Prentiss's   fake funeral and actual hospital expenses  cost the government more than $650,000."
1,"Imagine what sort of tab the BAU has run up altogether over the years with their not-quite-by-the-book antics (see  Screw the Rules, I'm Doing What's Right , below)."
1,The disorder is identified by name.
1,""" He's a   nurse in the  E Rs  where the victims were brought , which allowed him to 'heroically' help the victims."
1,"Here, it is called ""Hero Homicide""."
0,"JJ, Haley, Fran Morgan, Sarah Jacobs, assorted victims like Maggie from ""Legacy""... really, it'd be easier to list the mothers that  don't  fit."
1,"  Prentiss does this in ""Lauren"" after being stabbed by Doyle, prompting Morgan to respond, of course, with  No One Gets Left Behind ."
1,"In ""Reckoner,"" the last name on Judge Schuller's hit list is his own."
0,"Oh, and the noise from the car crash is what told the nearby police and FBI where to go."
1,"Happens to the Cop of the Week played by Eric Close in ""Our Darkest Hour"", though   it's more of a case of ""I Have Your Sister and Daughter""."
1,"Though this normally applies to villains,   Prentiss takes a wooden stake to the gut in her knock-down, drag-out fight with Doyle ."
0,"Sure, there's that one, though there's never any evidence that he eats any of the victims himself."
1,"For another,   while the other girls are working each other up to kill her, convincing themselves that she's dead anyway because she's coughing and they have no medicine, she  picks up the hammer and kills one of them from behind ."
1,"So arguably it  is  a ""cough of death""... but the death isn't hers!"
1,"Played straight in ""Our Darkest Hour"":   the unsub played by Tim Curry doesn't harm children ."
1,"Erin Strauss, though she's sympathetic to Hotch after   Haley dies."
1,Though Straus isn't actually Internal Affairs.
1,She's just the big boss.
0,"Subverted in ""Birthright""; while it turns out that   the killer's father was also a killer, this is not portrayed as being genetic, and rather the result of a teenager who was raised to worship his dead father finding his dad's old journal and deciding to carry on the family tradition."
1,"Meanwhile, the father's other son, who's known for years that he was born out of rape, is a perfectly nice guy ."
1,"In another episode, the unsub claims that he has an inherited chromosomal disorder that makes him predisposed to violent crimes."
1,This is met by Rossi pointing out that the study linking that particular disorder to violent crime had been debunked years ago.
0,"He tells the agents to get out, and they do so, right before the bombs strapped to the guy detonate and he becomes paint on the walls."
1,"The Reaper makes an attempt at this at the climax of ""100,"" but Hotch doesn't buy it and   beats him to death."
1,More likely that Hotch was too far in his  DespairEventHorizon  to care.
1,"Although, this one is a woman killing men."
1,This is actually one of the more out-there theories about the real Ripper's identity.
1,"Since he was never caught, we can never know."
1,It's the work of a copycat who wants to see the unsub released; the team realizes this because the copycat's  modus operandi  varies from certain signature details which were withheld by the police.
1,"The killer in ""Zoe's Reprise"" is  Jack the Ripoff  in human form."
1,"Morgan is just in time to   save Prentiss before she can bleed out , but thanks to   Hotch and JJ's plan to fake Emily's death , he's led to believe he wasn't."
1,He later tortures himself with the idea that being sixty seconds earlier could have changed everything.
1,"Nothing happens to   either of the two  Papa Wolves  from ""3rd Life"" (though they were, if not exactly sympathetic, certainly understandable), nor do we ever learn the fate of   the second killer family  from ""Bloodlines."
1,""" None of these were the primary UnSub, though."
1,"""The executive branch"" does this to the BAU team when it   puts forward the decision to transfer JJ out of the BAU, completely disregarding their family ."
1,"Ellie Spicer in ""The Longest Night"", who stands up to a serial killer who's just   murdered her father in front of her, left her aunt to die, and has been killing in  every single state for twenty-six years ."
0,:  Rossi is slick like an oil spill.
0,"Particularly impressive in ""Reckoner"" when he has not only the UnSub believing he'd slept with the UnSub's wife multiple times, but  the entire team  believing it, too."
1,"Also used in   ""Cold Comfort"" , where it's left ambiguous whether or not   Stanley Usher was genuinely psychic , in ""Demonology"", where one line of dialogue suggests that maybe   John Cooley actually is possessed  and   it's only ever a theory that the holy water was poisoned , and in another episode when   the possessed Voodoo priest told Reid (who had been experiencing migraines and visions) that he had ""ghosts"" in his brain (there's no physical problem with his brain and now he's terrified he might be going crazy like his mom) ."
1,""")  Done more subtly in ""Revelations"":   Tobias Hankel  calls his Russian Roulette game ""God's will""."
1,"He tries to shoot   Reid  at least five times and fails, but when   Reid steals his revolver he kills Tobias on the first try."
1,"Averted in ""The Angel Maker"" were everything is eventually explained and it was delibrately made to look like the supernatural going on."
1,However it did take the orginal Unsub a long time to die and his death freaked the Doctor out so much he quit excutions.
1,"Does   the Devil really come for poor Lara  at the end of ""Heathfield Manor"", or is she just as crazy as her brother and mother?"
1,"The name of the  General Ripper  in ""Dorado Falls"" who  caused the episode's  Sympathetic Murderer 's  Start of Darkness  by forcing him to assassinate two innocent children to keep a covert Navy SEALS operation quiet ?"
1,"The father is killed, but the son is the last surviving victim   For bonus  Unfortunate Implications , she's  almost always white, too."
0,(looks at the team)  Try to look less official.
1,"The unsub's mom is dead, despite the fact she seems to appear in public."
1,"Of course, if you know what  homage the episode is making , you'll have spotted it."
0,"The hitman in ""Natural Born Killer"" got sloppy in the triple murder that opens the episode because one of the victims was a woman and he identified her with his mother."
1,"The unsub of  The Uncanny Valley    was sexually abused by her father, who then gave her repeated electric shocks to shut her up about it."
1,It's also a valid  Freudian Excuse .
1,"The unsub of ""Normal"" shoots random motorists because   his daughter was struck and killed by a speeding car ."
1,"When he realizes it, it results in a serious  Villainous BSOD  complete with  My God, What Have I Done?"
1,", adding to the sob story assuming  anyone still felt sympathetic for him ."
1,"We see a father watch a tape of his  Psychopathic Manchild  brother torturing his own daughter, covering his ears in fear as she screams."

0,Is that a word?
0,"The prostitute he's with uses it to call Reid, saving Harris's life."
1,"Prentiss'   assumed death  was this for Morgan, and he's been slow to get over it."
1,""" Of course, it's somewhat ironic in that he actually managed to save Prentiss he just doesn't know it."
1,"They found  a  body   that Morgan claimed was her body so his family could move on , and later   found Cindi alive ."
1,A subversion occurs in the end when its discovered   the guy whose death sparked the BAU's involvement in the case wasn't a victim of the killer and did just commit suicide.
1,"Also seen in ""Risky Business,"" when JJ refuses to believe that several teens from the same school, with no apparent risk factors, would kill themselves."
1,"They took webcam videos of their deaths, which were then were downloaded and backed up on DVD by the unsub who used the game to lure them into killing themselves ."
0,"The killer himself, however, never says anything to indicate that he is one."
1,"In Hotch's defense, though,  Foyet  did fake his own near-death once by stabbing himself so many times that the police thought he was one of the victims."
1,Hotch was probably right to make sure he was down for the count.
1,To not even  move  as the bullet goes right by his shoulder into the wall behind him .
1,"After spending almost the entire episode playing the  Obstructive Bureaucrat  role in trying to get all the facts from the team, she actually almost tears up as Hotch finishes his report ."
1,"The expression on the unsub's face   before he gets blown up  at the end of ""Ashes and Dust""."
1,)  Garcia even  got shot.
1,"Oh, and half the time, when Reid isn't getting kidnapped or held hostage or  infected with anthrax , the case is still hitting him in the gut: nightmares, visions of himself in the victim's shoes, etc."
1,"(In ""Minimal Loss"", when  Emily takes the beating to keep him from getting shot ."
1,"Prentiss in ""Lauren""; Hotch even goes so far as to   declare Prentiss the victim and her abductor, Doyle, the UnSub ."

0,Morgan looks at a picture drawn by an autistic kid and can't figure out what it is.
1,He felt so bad about the murder that he had been sending fluffy toys as presents every year on the anniversary as an apology.
1,"The unsub in ""To Hell...""/""And Back"" was revealed to be   an overgrown manchild who was being manipulated into stealing the stem cells of homeless people by his quadriplegic mad scientist older brother."
1,"The unsub from ""The Uncanny Valley"" is probably an example of this as well, as   she has the mind of a young child, due to verbal and sexual abuse she suffered from her  father ."
1,"She just wants a pretty set of dolls, the perfect set, to play with."
1,"The unsub from ""Proof"" is an extremely dark one."

1,""" Playing  Kick the Dog  was fun too."
1,"At the end of the season 5 opener,  Hotchner's ex-wife Haley and his son Jack get whisked off into protective custody in order to protect them from the serial killer known as the Reaper, which means that Hotchner will lose all contact with Haley and more importantly, with his young son Jack as long as the Reaper is on the loose."

1,"Lampshaded in the season four gag reel, in which Shemar Moore kicks down a door that the crew has unhinged so that the entire door just falls off."

1,"Near the end he realizes   there was no other driver and that he is responsible for the crash that cost him his legs and wife, as he had fallen asleep at the wheel ."
1,"Although this seems inconsistent with   the later discovery of Prentiss' background as a badass undercover agent,  it is conceivable that the rest of the team could have been barred from that info (at least until they're cleared in ""Lauren"")."
1,"This does not, however, account for the discrepancy between Prentiss' original season 2 statement that she had then been with the Bureau for ten years and the revelation in ""Lauren"" that   a mere seven years earlier, she was instead working for Interpol and/or the CIA, apparently."
1,"Well, the statement was just that, a statement."

1,They don't even make it through the episode.
1,"Reid had  Tobias Hankel, the Dissociative Identity Disorder-afflicted killer of ""The Big Game"" and ""Revelations"") , who stays with him for two reasons: first, the drug addiction  Story Arc  that comes from  being shot full of Dilaudid  three times  over the course of ""Revelations"" , is developed in ""Fear and Loathing,"" ""Distress,"" ""Jones,"" and ""Ashes and Dust,"" and  comes back for further development in ""Elephant's Memory"" and ""Amplification"" ."
1,"Second, even though  the alternate personalities of Tobias's father and the archangel Raphael tortured Reid, made him choose someone to save and thus doom others to being new victims, and played Russian roulette with him , Tobias showed him empathy  despite also being the one to inject Reid with aforementioned Dilaudid , and, as seen in ""Conflicted,""  gives him the insight to figure out Adam/Amanda's identity as the unsub , but also  makes him feel as though he owes something to Tobias and keeps him coming back to try and help Amanda to let Adam's personality resurface ."

1,It wouldn't have been quite so bad if the last victim hadn't been  scalped .
0,It's as though the BAU family is torn apart.

1,Also obviously Morgana   due due to her powers as a seer  which ultimatly are often ignored especially by   Arthur  who   frequently dismisses them as nightmares or taking it as a sign of romantic attraction that she dreams about him (this is entirely shippers choice although it does seem to be rather obvious in season 1!

1,Guess who appears in  3x01 .
1,"Though when you think about it, there are quite a few explanations for the 'deaths' of those knights: it could merely be a dramatic subversion of  Early-Bird Cameo  by in turn averting the  One Steve Limit , or the legends of Arthur's court be rather inaccurate, or perhaps one or two of those knights could end up being ressurrected (without turning evil) later on."

0,"Nimueh succeeds with one in "" The Poisoned Chalice "" with a plot to force Merlin into drinking poison by switching Arthur's chalice with a poisoned one, disguising herself as a serving girl, and telling Merlin that she witnessed the visiting lord of another kingdom spike the chalice that he presents to Arthur as a gift."
0,Lancelot  almost  achieves this when he faces death with the knowledge that Guinevere has escaped - up until he realizes that she's been recaptured.
1,"In 4x02,   Lancelot does it again when he sacrifices himself to close the veil."

1,"After   enlisting the help of a sorcress in order for his barren wife to conceive , he set about killing and terrorising everyone who practised sorcery (even those who did so for perfectly innocent reasons) even though  he had no one to blame for his wife's death except himself ."
1,"You'd think this act of blatant hypocrisy would make him decide to ease up on the sorcerers a bit from then on, but you'd be wrong...  Later on in series 3, there was a sorcerer going around healing people miraculously who was   Gaius's former lover ."
1,Uther wanted Gaius to see if sorcery was involved in the healings and it is implied he would have executed whoever did it.
1,The fact that he was willing to use magic to miraculously heal Morgana is made even more hypocritical because of that in retrospect.
1," /  Kill The Ones You Love  /  Shoot the Dog  Merlin poisons Morgana   who was unsware that she was the vessel of the Knights of Medhir   because  he did what he had to do  in order to save Camelot, but at the price of killing his friend and someone he cared about."

1,Merlin brings   Freya to the lake so that she dies in a place similar to her home .
0,"According to  Bradley James , the reason why they put a halt to  Arthur/Morgana  was to not get the impression of  Brother-Sister Incest  (since she is like his  sister-in-law ), and because they wanted to start the  Arthur/Gwen romance ."

0,Morgana's strong attachment towards Mordred causes her to become very protective of him and a willingness to do anything for him in order to keep him from harm's way.
1,"And it was Arthur who went for it, no less."
0,"Averted, Merlin doesn't have it in this version."
1,"In 2x09,  right before the Bastet kills the couple and the guards, we see the scene through its eyes ."
1,Gaius is also morally ambiguous (though by no means evil).
1,"He focuses on Merlin's safety to the point of denying help to other magicians who need it, including Mordred and Morgana, which brings him into conflict with Merlin's  Chronic Hero Syndrome ."
0,It's also implied he betrayed Nimueh and his other fellow magic-users to Uther as a young man.
0,Bradley James' (Arthur's) shirt collar becomes progressively more open with each episode.

0,"Gwen even comments, ""nice hat,"" in between giggles."
1,  Freeing the dragon is not Merlin's best idea ever.
1,Merlin's treatment of   Morgana and Mordred is a contributing cause of her  Face Heel Turn  and his  Start of Darkness .
1,"To some extent perhaps,   Merlin trying to heal Uther - even though Uther's death isn't his fault, Merlin/Dragoon's price to gain peace for the magic-users may be lost."
1,Works to Merlin's benefit   when lifting the dragon's egg causes the tower in which it was hidden to collapse.
0,Uther might be a genocidal tyrant but he's also a loving parent and a brave warrior who will put himself in harm's way to protect his kingdom.
0,"While they usually don't believe him, they trust him enough to give him the benefit of the doubt."
0,Gwen I'm that is not true.
1,Then he died when Merlin finally met him.
1,Morgana views   Uther keeping the secret that he is her real father  explicitly as this.
1,"Plus, it's not like Arthur hates or even dislikes her, and like the prince would throw her out had he the chance."
1,"In short, Morgana is literally living like a princess and she is set for a life as such, but she's ready to kill  her father  because he won't jeopardize his position (and hers, as been pointed in the  Succession Crisis  entry below )."
1,"Yes, Uther is a hypocritical tyrant on many levels, but while his treatment of magical people or even of Morgana's ""father"" (Gorlois) are very slow in turning her against him, as soon as he declines recognising her as his daughter, she immediately tries to kill him."
1,"Spoiled child's tantrum, much?"
0,Gaius is this towards Merlin.
1, Morgana has a definite hand in finally killing Uther .
0,"Actually, Gwen's physical appearance may just be one of the least anachronistic aspects of the show: her darker skin and curly hair suggest that she is  Silurian  (no, not  that  kind of Silurian)."
0,Arthur does this to Merlin.
1,"Also,  Morgana , but  we all saw this coming."
1,A  True Love's Kiss  from Gwen does the job.
1,"Needless to say, she  reacted poorly  when she tried to use her magic later."
1,Also a  Call Back  to Season 3 when Morgana   put a doll beneath Uther's bed and made him go crazy .
1,"And every promise has been kept, or at least it has been hinted that they will ."
1,Arthur broke his promise to Guinevere that her home was hers for life when he  banished her from Camelot .
1,"Yes, there were mitigating circumstances, but the promise was still broken."
1,"Also, who wants to bet that  the Cup of Life in ""Le Morte d'Arthur"" is actually the Holy Grail?"
1,We've now also seen the Round Table.

1,The crown for the Queen of Camelot (as worn by  Morgana and then Guinevere ) is larger and covered in jewels.
0,"No matter how many awful things Uther does, Arthur continues to fight for his approval and affection."
1,"It's revealed in series three that the Pendragon men have a history of mental illness, one which King Uther ultimately succumbs to after his  illegitimate daughter  betrays him and takes the throne."

0,"After Arthur had killed a unicorn, the keeper of the unicorns tested him on a few occasions, to see if he was pure-hearted."
1,"The Dragon warns Merlin about her turning evil, and as a result Merlin drives her away."
1,Merlin's attempts to   prevent the potential future which he has seen in  The Crystal Cave  lead to this.
1,Morgana's schemes to break up Arthur and Gwen only cements their relationship.
1,"Elena, especially when that  sidhe was removed from inside her."
0,And the show  knows  this.
0,"Why yes, we are keeping careful track."
0," / Proper Lady: Arguably, Gwen: patient, gentle, devoted to her loved ones but doesn't hesitate to take up arms when Camelot or someone she cares for is in danger."
0,Merlin assumes the spirit wants revenge against the deceased Uther and is targeting Arthur instead.
0,Although Arthur doesn't know it.
1,It comes true in 3.12 when she temporarily overthrows Uther and appoints herself queen.
1,"It's ironic because   both Morgause, Morgana and it appears Agravaine as well seem to be under the impression that an unacknowledged, unmarried bastard daughter could actually take the throne legitimately."
1,"Morgana also seems a bit pissed that Uther never acknowledged her, not seeming to realise that declaring her his bastard child would take her massively far down in status as opposed to making her a princess."
1,"Morgause and Morgana simpy plan to kill Arthur, because they think that, with only one child left, Uther would ""no"" choice but no make Morgana his crowned heir: after all, we are shown that it's not a simple matter of lineage, as Arthar has to be made official heir, that ""legitimacy"" is taken away later in the two-parter episode and Catrina becomes in turn the designated heir; in addition, Uther reminds Arthur that he personally had to win his kingdom, not inherit it, and thus puts Arthur though quite a few ordeals and trials to judge if his son is ready to become king."
1,"On the other hand and for added  Fridge Logic , if Arthur died and Uther made Morgana his heir, the king would probably not even need to officially recognise her as his daughter, as the fact she's been his ward for half her life, that she's had first row seat to how to rule a kingdom, and that he dearly loved her would easily explain it to the whole kingdom."
1,"So, really, the whole ""she's actually his daughter"" is not really useful in terms of usurping the throne; it's far more useful to show Uther as an hypocrite, Morgana's sliding deeper into evil, and complicating the whole Morgana issue for Arthur."

0,Monk can often figure out the crime this way before he has any solid evidence and spends the rest of the episode obtaining said evidence.

1,"Although he certainly succeeded in having the grill ignite, actually having the fan killed by the explosion wasn't nearly as successful, as the only real damage he did to the fan was burn his right hand (a good subsitute for an ice pack or bandage is to put a rubber foam glove over it)."
1,"Also, unlike most uses of this trope, it wasn't  Played for Laughs ."
1,"It is heavily implied that, although Trudy's murder via a bombing didn't cause Monk's issues, but it certainly made it a lot worse than before, suffering a mental breakdown that forced him into early retirement from the force before the start of the series, and necessitated therapy as well as  finding Trudy's killer, not to mention learning that the car bomb was intended for Trudy all along and not a backfired assassination attempt on him  that he ever gets better."
1,"He also has relatively minor episodes within the main  Heroic BSOD , namely pertained to whether he can get his old job back or not (such as when he was not only removed from the case, but also had his detective's license revoked by the commissioner simply because he accidentially deleted a few years worth of forensic files while attempting to eliminate crumbs from the keyboard, or when a four-year hiring freeze threatened his chances of reinstatement)."
0,"A prior instance of this is where he has a cold case about a valedictorian student being killed by a drunk driver, and this combined with Monk's greater skill as a detective, left him frequently depressed."
1,The fact that he was having marital problems stemming from not watching a documentary (which turned out to be a  Chekhov's Gun  to finding out the murderer for both their current case and his cold case) that forced him to stay with Monk didn't help matters much .
0,"To avoid causing problems, it was necessary for writers to position Natalie during scenes such that her midsection and below is hidden by items like bags, tables, or car doors."

0,It turns out to be true.
1,Monk himself often is in this trope:   In  Mr.
1,"Monk Goes to the Dentist , he has a crippling fear of dentists due to a bad experience, a fear so severe, in fact, that he was completely unwilling to go beyond the waiting room while Disher and Natalie investigate a murder that seemingly happened while Disher was getting his appointment regarding a seeming kidnapping of ""Barry Bonds,"" and later had to be pried off when he was literally frozen in fear in his seat during the wait (presumably from hearing a drill whirring in the background)."
1,"Turns out he was very much justified in this fear, as he ends up being abducted and then tortured by the same dentists in regards to potential clients for the bearer bonds and whether the police had them monitored (an incident that also resulted in his fear of them being heightened as a result to the extent that he refuses to go to a dentist even after one of his teeth was chipped)."
1,"Randy Disher was also in this trope in the same episode (the Dentist one),   as during the dental procedure for a legitimate toothache, and while being placed in novacane, he ends up witnessing a brutal confrontation between the dentists and a bald man demanding for ""Barry Bonds"" and that ""he was worth $13 billion,"" and tried to report it to his co-workers, only to be laughed at and/or met with disbelief (the fact that he was currently being doped up on novacane when it was happening did not help matters much on his end, either), eventually being fed up at not being believed and quitting the force."

1,"Also counts as  Character Development  since, at the start of the series, TK is a egotistical player who doesn't want to share the limelight with anyone and who is more interested in himself than his time."
1,So letting someone else score in such a big moment is a huge sign of where he's come.
1,"Emphasized by the fact that despite not scoring at all in the game or putting up big numbers, TK is truly happy and celebrates on the win rather than become destructive over the lack of limelight."

1,"When it came to main characters, the six core Noob members, Golgotha and the Justice Guild top four weren't part of it and   the two other Empire players that had been introduced at the time were probably part of the Order by the time Season 3 started ."
1,The fact hence only seemed to contribute to the plot by being the reason   Fantm  couldn't form a temporary party for dungeons and had to join the Noob guild.
1,"However, during the Empire-Coalition war that was the setting for the Season 3 finale, Gaea recognizes a member of the Coalition guild that wants to protect her as former Empire player (who was chatting with the Noob guild members right before Season 2's battlefield sequence)."
1,"The next scene happens in the Lepape household where Ystos is borrowing a microphone from a still shaken Sparadrap whom he needs to reassure, leading to another tear jerker, followed by a more optimist scene ."

1,Relic Tracker's guild also once plans to do it by kill stealing from the Noob guild  and succeed .

0,"The message was neither meant for him nor to be cryptic, but Omega Zell got a quite bad case during the first in-game conversation between Sparadrap and his brother, that happenened in his presence."
1,"After getting a demonstration of the younger brother's talent at the game (via control of Sparadrap's avatar) a few episodes earlier, he manages to not do the math when   its best healer   calls Sparadrap by his real name ,  gets suprised by him not recognizing his voice ,  gets told by Sparadrap he imitates his brother quite well  and  corrects misremembered facts only said brother would know about ."

1,A dedicated guild turns out to exist in the Coalition later on.
0,"Also, despite real life scenes being more and more present, not a single person not playing  Horizon  has been shown on screen (that gets a little relaxed in the books and comic)."
1,"The events of Season 3 altered the situation towards   Fantm getting along with the Noob guild (and even explicitly considering them true friends in the third book), Omega Zell included ."
1,"And in Season 4   Fantm not only pressures Saphir to let Omega Zell into Justice guild, but signs him up into its main roster behind her back, under the pretext it gives him the opportunity to pay the Noob guild back for its help ."
0,"On the more subtle end, when Sparadrap had to make a second avatar in Season 2, Omega Zell started a little exposition speech about how it was impossible to make it join the Noob guild in Arthon's absence before seeming to come back to his senses and refusing to help him."
1,"In Season 3, Gaea's reaction to   Roxana killing Sparadrap's pets, that she was planning to steal and sell off  shocked him,  hinting that he acknolowdged how important they were to their owner ."
1,"In Season 4,  Sparadrap considered Omega Zell leaving the guild a bad enough matter to go tell Arthon in real life while it looks like he only found out about Gaea after Kary having exams happened to enable him to join Sparadrap for a dungeon ."
1, and it would make sense for Ystos to just view Fantm as an older brother  given who his actual one is .
1,"  Omega Zell leaving the guild  in Season 4, that Sparadrap considers to be the worse thing that happened since Arthon stopped caring for the guild   at the time , is shown happening while   Couette  is playing joyful music and dancing to celebrate becoming the first member of the guild to reach level 100."
1,"And, for those who know how the story goes, that fact that  the game's creators have been enhancing Fantm's stats behind his back each time he got in enough trouble to put his number one rank at risk ."
0,Sparadrap takes it Up To Eleven by caring about NPCs and monsters that are acutally meant to be beaten up.
1,"The encounters between the two actually loose their  Running Gag  status in Season 4 when they lead to   Dark Avenger no longer being scary to anyone, getting kicked out of the player killer guild, and quitting the game ."
1,"He names his guild ""Noob"", ends up having an actual n00b in it, said n00b end up pissing him off to the point that the infamous  Appliance Defenestration  happens ; this is especially strange given that   Master Zen later comes up with a much better name for his new guild ."
1,Gaea even lampshades the lousy name choice the first time she hears it.
1,"To top it off, thanks to  You Are in Command Now  happening three times in about as many episodes during Season 4, Sparadrap  is  in charge of the guild by the end of episode 5."

1,2) How hard is  John going to punch Sherlock  when they're reunited ?
1,"In  A Scandal in Belgravia , Mycroft comments that it would take nothing less than Sherlock's expertise to convince him that   Irene Adler is  not   Faking the Dead ."

0, when some completely circumstancial evidence leads them to believe that  Sherlock kidnapped and poisoned two children.
1,"Anderson even speculates that Sherlock may have committed  twenty or thirty crimes  that he had helped the police investigate in the past, despite the fact that this makes absolutely no sense."
1,"Of course, if these assumptions were correct, it would have meant that  Sherlock  had the  Idiot Ball , since  among other things, he went in person, undisguised in any way, to interview a child he apparently kidnapped, who recognised him immediately and screamed her head off."

1,He's only stopped by a well-placed shot from John.
1,"Interestingly, the serial killer in the pilot version of the story was not this way at all:  the cabbie simply drugs Sherlock in public (with everyone around assuming thanks to his acting that he's simply drunk), drags him back to his home, and presents him with the pill game when Sherlock is still too drugged to really fight him off."

1,"To be a  little  more specific, his reaction when  Jim Moriarty commits suicide, totally unexpectedly and  inches away from his face,  is an  Oh Crap  of frankly epic proportions."
1,"Here, and in one scene in particular, he's reduced to a ""nave, lonely man desperate to show off"", revealed to  not be Moriarty's main target at all,  played for a sucker with a classic  Damsel in Distress  ploy that Mycroft describes as ""textbook""  and referred to in all sorts of ways that range from the dismissive to the insulting: ""Mr Holmes, the Younger"", ""Junior"", ""the clever detective in the funny hat"", ""The Virgin""."
1,"Heck, even a case he spent some time on was solved by the brilliant Mycroft in seconds, and another case,  that of the Dsseldorf air crash and the missing victim, was actually part of something  orchestrated  by Mycroft."

1,Amanda Perry builds a simulation in  Destiny's  computer so she and Rush can actually touch each other.
1,Rush ends up trapped in the simulation because one of the base parameters was the condition that he loves Perry as she loves him.
1,"Rush insists that the program is simply wrong about his feelings, which is where the debatable part comes in."
1,"The first possibility is that Rush really doesn't love her, and thus the trope is averted because  Destiny  not only knows what love is but can measure it."
1,"The second possibility is that Rush does love her, and thus the computer is inherently incapable of judging this on a case by case basis."
1,"The most likely explanation in this case is that it used Perry's feelings as a baseline, and couldn't get the same reaction from Rush."

1,"Similarly, the titular ship's crew in the episode   Valiant  abandon ship in the episode's climax, with the Dominion forces  destroying many of the lifepods  (though it's not clear if this was intentional, or just because they were still pummeling the ship into its constituent subatomic particles; in a later episode the Female Founder told her soldiers specifically to let the lifepods escape, so that the survivors would spread terror when they retold the story of their defeat."
1," The  Defiant  had to be abandoned a couple times as well, notably in ""The Search, Part I"" (in which Odo and Kira get to a shuttle while Sisko and Bashir get to a separate one off-camera ( though it turns out they actually  were  captured and the Alpha Quadrant events of Part II are all taking place in a simulated reality ); and also in ""The Changing Face of Evil"", after the  Defiant  is hit by the Breen's energy-dampening weapon ( this time, the ship is actually destroyed )."

1,"After  the  Defiant  is destroyed , four episodes later a near-identical replacement is ready, and they even receive a ""special dispensation"" to rename it as such."

1,"Furthering the  Alternate Character Interpretation , Denise Riley stating 'what everyone was thinking' qualifies for this, if you consider her a  Complete Monster  - no one in the Cabinet is going to sign  their children up  to be taken by the 456, and if there's no other choice, why not get rid of  the underperforming children  who are likely to become the  'future drain on society'  and protect the future leaders?"

0,"Also applies to the legislative process in the show: In the space of one conversation, you go from hearing that a bunch of reports have been finished and sent to the President and HHS Secretary to the recommendations becoming law at midnight that night without even a  hint  of enabling legislation having been previously passed?"
1,"Even though Danes is guilty of a  very  nasty crime, the Constitution of the United States of America prohibits making an act illegal before the law was put into power, which means he can't be categorized and sentenced under this new law for an offense he committed before the law was passed."
1,"Also, putting folks into the ovens conscious would almost assuredly qualify as cruel and unusual punishment."
1,"Technically, the emergency mandate is not an ex post facto law as he was previously sentenced to death and the law is merely changing the administration of his punishment."
1,"However, the show's misuse of force majeure which is not even invoked in American criminal law should be taken to task."
1,It returns to him at the end; and Rex gains it too .
1,Rex bites Esther's head off for   visiting her sister's house and being made by a hitman  when he  visited his dad while they're in Venice Beach and could have compromised them as well had Esther not already done so.
1,"Since nobody knows what Rex did, he can continue acting smug towards Esther without her realizing his hypocrisy."
1,"Also, to be fair, Rex is trained in that sort of thing and Ester isn't."
1,"Visiting her sister also leads a hitman to their new hideout, nearly getting Jack and Gwen killed/would-be-killed."
1,"Then they instituted the Category system, and things  genuinely  got a lot worse."
1,And then there's Episode 8.
1,"Not only is the world on the verge of a new Great Depression, but things for the individual characters get a lot worse personally."
1,Or so one would hope.

1,"Gwen calls one of the camp doctors out on this, going so far as to tell her not to call herself a doctor anymore, because she doesn't deserve it."
0,It's never made clear how  three wealthy families were able to attain that much power in the world beyond spending decades insinuating themselves into the top political/financial/media (one family for each) positions and families in the world and working together on trying to become immortal .
1,They're not even mentioned to be using any alien technology.
