1,"Neither of their bodies show much sign of injury after the fight, despite the several ""stabbing"" sound-effects you can hear during the fight."

0,Difficult to avoid when making a flashy dinosaur show.
1,The baby  Allosaurus's  broken jaw is one instance of this.
1,It's quite horrific to look at and even makes the mother have a double take.
1,"The death of the antagonistic  Tyrannosaurus , with  huge  amounts of blood gushing from its neck."
1,"In both cases the protagonist moves in to feed on the body of the story's  Big Bad , but does so just outside of the camera frame."

1,The baby Mosasaurs chirp like baby birds while getting attacked by the sharks.
1,Even when they go to the bottom to hide they don't shut up.
0,Mostly averted at least by the  Anhanguera .
0,"Also note that  Rhamphorhynchus  is thought to have had behaved like modern nocturnal sea birds (avoiding thus competition from diurnal pterosaurs that also hunted fish in the same regions), thus seeing one far from the open sea and on daylight would not be very common."
0,"There are  Cryolophosaurus ,  Sinraptor ,  Eoraptor ,  Torvosaurus ,  Majungasaurus ,  Rahonavis ,  Miragaia ,  Glacialisaurus ,  Mamenchisaurus ,  Rapetosaurus ,  Lusotitan ,  Shunosaurus ,  Gigantoraptor ,  Draconyx ,  Cedarosaurus ,  Guanlong , freakin'  Dinheirosaurus ... But the most interesting examples are the non-dinosaurian  Saurosuchus ,  Anhanguera ,  Castorocauda  (a water-going mammal relative),  Volaticotherium  (the Jurassic ""flying squirrel""),  Probelesodon  (a non-mammalian cynodont),  Zalambdalestes  (a small placental mammal),  Ischigualastia  (a dicynodont),  Inostrancevia  (a gorgonopsid),  Cretoxyrhina  (a shark), and the (by modern standards) ungodly large frog  Beelzebufo ."
0,Many of these were discovered  while the show was still in production .
0,"A segment fittingly titled ""Pterosaur  Looney Tunes "" puts a tragic spin on the character of Beaky Buzzard's momma from the cartoon shorts, in the form of a strange  Anhanguera  mother who's  too dumb to let her hatchlings live ."
0,"While not particularly recent discoveries, this show gets the abelisaurid and sauropod hands right when most other depictions do not."
0,"While this idea is not unreasonable, it is based on only circumstantial evidence and isn't anywhere as set in stone as commonly portrayed."
0,"Due to time constraints, the  Ornitholestes  is the one coelurosaur on the show that lacks feathers."
1,"A mammal runs into frame and he charges at it, only to fall off the cliff and die."
1,A fish being chased by the  Castorocauda  tries to escape by  leaping onto land  (!?!?
1,One of the earliest clips released showed  the death of the  Torvosaurus .
1,One of the flipcards on the Discovery website shows the  very end of the last episode .
1,"The images and footage of the death itself may make it look like the  Tyrannosaurus  died fighting a  Triceratops , when it was really fighting the protagonist  Tyrannosaurus  and was knocked onto a  Triceratops  carcass."
1,"One moment  three  Ischigualastia  attack the  Saurosuchus , the next the  Saurosuchus  appears to be fighting just one  Ischigualastia ."
1,"The  Utahraptor  try this on a young  Cedarosaurus , but it doesn't end well for them when the adult  Cedarosaurus  come to its rescue ."
0,"Season with a bunch of guest stars from Joss Whedon's stable, including  Summer Glau , Alexis Denisof,  Amy Acker , Alan Tudyk,  Eliza Dushku  in the starring role of Echo, and breakout performances by Fran Kranz and Enver Gjokaj, and we have a Dollhouse."
0,"Note: the true finale of Season One, ""Epitaph One,"" is actually a  Lost Episode  on the DVD and Blu-ray sets."
1," Boyd was this  in ""The Hollow Men"" and  Topher (by his own choice)  in ""Epitaph Two: Return."
1,"Boyd too, as he truly cares for Echo and her emotional growth into her own being, as well as considering the people at the LA Dollhouse to be his  True Companions ."
1,"Of course, he also wants to harvest Echo's spinal fluid and allowed his private army to raid the Dollhouse too."
1,"To quote Tim Minear: ""I shot Bennett in the head because it's funny."
1,"""  In the finale,   Paul is shot dead with no warning, and then Topher performs a  Heroic Sacrifice  to truly save the world ."
1, directed at  Boyd  was pretty much the fans' reaction.
1,It was kind of like finding out your Dad who you loved without reservation was a serial killer.
1,"Then again, being Joss, it's one of his signature styles."
1,"Don't ask what happened to   Wash and Book  in  Firefly , just don't."
1,"""Epitaph One"" (1x13) and ""Epitaph Two: Return"" (2x13):  the imprinted ""butchers,"" who had been imprinted to kill all those  who weren't imprinted to kill all those that weren't imprinted to kill..."
1,"Actually, the show is pretty chock-full of crazy."
1,"Meanwhile, Adelle sends Sierra's handler to get rid of Mellie, only to   interrupt the assassination attempt by remotely activating Mellie's Active state."
1,"However,  Word Of God  is that we're supposed to take that statement at face value... for now."
1,"Male beauty as well, as he does the same thing to   Victor  in ""Briar Rose"" (1x11)."
1,"We always knew Rossum was bad news, and as of ""Getting Closer"" (2x11), we know just who is in charge Boyd Langton ."
1,"Hey you see   Boyd Langton,  Papa Wolf  to the actives, father figure to Echo, seemingly all-around nice and decent guy?"
1,He's the  Magnificent Bastard  head of Rossum pulling the strings on everything going on in a massive  Xanatos Gambit  that he's been running since before the first episode of the series.
0,"Brain manipulation, body hopping?"
1,"Also the storyline where Topher comes up with a way to weaponize the mindwipe technology, as far as moral implications of doing so especially when Rossum finds out about it, forcing Topher (who is horrified when his blueprints are taken from him by his mother-figure Adelle and given to Rossum) is forced to use the device on   Boyd, when he reveals himself to be the head of the company and who is aware of the apocalyptic implications of the technology and about to kill Echo, then turning him into a suicide bomber while in his new Doll-state ."
1,"""  Even the leads are morally compromised: Ballard's obsession with the Dollhouse leads him to do some morally questionable things, while Caroline (before she became Echo) was portrayed as a reckless, shortsighted activist/terrorist whose obsession with the Rossum Corporation led to   her boyfriend being murdered and her best friend losing the use of her left arm."
1,He seems to be rather conscience-stricken with regards to  her  condition once  Saunders realizes that she is a former doll .
1,"Adelle  used Victor for several ""romantic engagements"" and ultimately would have allowed Sierra to be permanently given to the man who had put her in the Dollhouse as his personal revenge, but eventually takes a stand against Rossum ."
0,"On the other hand, Rossum and Alpha are clearly evil, so they could be seen as the ""black"" part of the show's black and gray morality."
0,:  Actives when unimprinted.
1,She eventually   develops a full personality )  Also showing personality to a lesser extent   Sierra and Victor .
1,"This was  before   he was imprinted with   the personalities of 48 other people, turning him into a super-genius killing machine ."
1,"Alpha;  Daniel's ""wife,"" Cindy  is a  female example ."
1,"How   Ambrose and Harding  seem to operate, at least as of the  Time Skip ."
1,"So, a fun-loving ""female"" Victor is in a nightclub...  Repeated body swaps play into the  dystopia of ""Epitaph Two: Return"" (2x13)."
1,"In the future, Harding and Ambrose   the last survivors of the Rossum leadership   hold onto power by periodically taking over fresh bodies to gain a kind of immortality."
1,"When Echo shoots Harding dead, it's not for the first time; he even taunts Echo by reminding her his soul will simply be uploaded into more bodies."
1,"Though when November is re-imprinted as Mellie in ""Getting Closer"" (2x11), she doesn't hold this against him one bit and indeed loves him as much as ever."
1,"Saunders' confrontation with Alpha and  her realization that she's a doll  make her noticeably less sweet than before, at least initially."
1,Thanks to  Getting Closer ' and  Hollow Men  we know how  that's going to turn out.
1,Enver's got talent.
1,"This has led to Enver Gjokaj having a rather large fanbase, at least among Dollhouse fans."
1,":  Used in the fight between Echo and   Senator Perrin's wife/handler Cindy  in ""The Public Eye"" (2x05)."
1,"Every single move Echo makes is taken from fights she's been in in previous episodes, as proved by the constant flashbacks."
1,"Also a  Fridge Brilliance  demonstration of why composite events are exceedingly dangerous when it happens to someone like Alpha   being able to instantly access what could potentially amount to many lifetimes of information, skills, tactics, abilities and experience and use it precisely and exactly as need and applied."
1,"Topher's cool, slightly annoyed ""I know what I know"" (""Vows,"" (2x01)) becomes his  madness mantra  years later in ""Epitaph One"" (1x13)."
1,"And Echo's ""We are lost, but we are not gone""   also in ""Vows""   is repeated by her double, Caroline-in-Iris, a decade later in ""Epitaph Two: Return"" (2x13)."
1,Even when they're standing on top of it.
1,"Of course,  Adelle  uses this to her advantage beautifully."
1,  Stalker with a Crush  ran.
1,"That really was what was going on, but her faux diagnosis as a paranoid schizophrenic convinced Topher otherwise."
1, and are maneuvering to be in a position of power when the shit hits the fan.
0,""" It's ""Would you like a treatment?"
0,""" Paul  very woozy  No, I'm good."
1,"Your first warning that   ""Stephen""  was Alpha?"
1,The Doll outfit that shows off his muscles.
1,"""Epitaph One"":  The remote wipe introduced in ""Gray Hour"" and the Fountain of Youth idea from ""Haunted"" ."
0,"Saunders, because Saunders is actually Whiskey, and the apparent effects of the drug on her would have given the fact that she was a Doll away."
1,"Nolan Kinnard,  the man behind Sierra's  cutie-breaking  phase , has a minor part in the first-season episode ""Needs,"" but plays a much larger part a season later in ""Belonging""."
1,"Except she's been completely outplayed by  Boyd, who just  happens  to have gotten himself in a position where he must flee as the ""scapegoat"" just before Caroline is reawakened and can identify him as the mastermind behind Rossum."
1,"Stephen Kepler  aka Alpha  has one   once he changes into Doll attire, it becomes apparent how well built he is."
0,Adelle becomes this for   Topher.
1,":  In ""Vows"" (2x01), near the beginning,  DeWitt absentmindedly touches Victor's face, recalling the fact that she used to sleep with him."
1,"In ""Epitaph Two"" (2x13), Neuropolis running out of shellfish for Ambrose, a reference to him enjoying it in ""Epitaph One"" (1x13)."
1,:    Alpha posing as Stephen Kepler after killing him .
1,Averted  hard  with Bennett's death.
0,This can only be attributed to the fact that it's never the most obvious suspect.
0,Used when Rossum's founder makes a last ditch effort to convince his  pawns   family  that he needs to  mind control the world .
1, Perrin  removing Echo's GPS chip is shot  uncomfortably  like a sex scene.
1,"To a lesser extent,  Anthony ""killing"" Priya in the Attic  is shot much like a lovers' embrace, so much so that it sends Anthony into a  Heroic BSOD ."
1,"He insists on saving Caroline, NOT  Mellie/November , even."
1,"He seems to be bucking for  Tragic Hero  status here, especially as Echo  doesn't like  Ballard."
0,"By the series finale, everyone has an opportunity to put it all on the line."
1,"Mag is in a wheelchair, Paul is shot dead, Alpha must leave his new family, Echo goes through Hell (aka The Attic) and grieves Paul's death, Adelle is on the verge of a breakdown, Topher has gone through a  Heroic Sacrifice , etc."
1,"It's interesting to note that finally, after all these other shows, Priya and Anthony actually  do  stay together, when most of the fandom was just waiting for Joss to tear them apart in angsty fashion."
1,"Although it should be noted,   Mag may not be in a wheelchair permanently, and Ballard's consciousness is uploaded into Echo ."
1,But Alpha  was  the one who gave it to her.
1,"Nice job breaking it, villain."
1,"For a lot of Fans, the revelation that Boyd   being the big Bad had been moved to  Fan Discontinuity  based on his realisticly warm and father like air in Season one."
1,Joss comments at ComicCon reveal that Boyd was never intended to be the traitor until mid Season two.
1,The reason that Henry Lennix was able to play a lovable Giles like figure  was because that what he thought he was.
1,DeWitt and Dominic's punishment of doll-rapist  Hearn  probably counts too.
1,And Alpha came up with whatever technique they have for resisting imprinting.
1,Topher could have  made Sierra into a sex toy for his birthday but didn't.
1,"Likewise he makes it quite clear in ""Vows"" (2x01) that he would never do that to any of the Dolls."
1,"In ""Belle Chose"" (2x03), when the Dollhouse managers discover the VIP they're trying to wake up from a coma is a potential serial killer, and a very disturbing one at that, they become much less inclined to wake him up."
1,Lampshaded:  Boyd:  Topher  has ethical problems [with this].
1," One could argue that, due to  Black and Grey Morality , everyone on the show is evil in one way or another, but no one compares to Boyd Langton, Echo's father figure, the head of security, Dr."
0,"(In Season 2, they become real guest stars."
0,"However, it's described as ""Like having a word at the tip of your tongue, but for every thought you never have"", which is somewhat  worse ."
0,"An interesting take on this""And you'll tell them everything's  fine."
0,:  Echo is barefoot at all times while inside the Dollhouse.
1,Foreshadowing.
1,"The first episode of season 2 features Echo demanding, and getting, a foot massage from Ballard."
0,Season 2 seems to have normal-length commercials.
0,"It didn't work, making them  less  money since very few advertisers were willing to pay the premium price."
1,"The finale, ""Epitaph TwoThe Return"", comes about...  and the currently more-sane Alpha , who the ""Epitaphs"" comics later reinforce has    only become less-psychotic because of having non-psycho Paul's imprint in his mind acting as a conscience , decides to allow   the imprint-wiping, original-personality-returning signal  to hit him."
1,"Remember,   the reason he was in jail and thus available for Doll-ification by Rossum, is that he was a psychotic killer  before the Dollhouse got hold of him ."
1,"So now, not only is   Alpha back to his original personality , he's also   no longer imprisoned or in any way restrained, no one knows he is loose or even still alive, and he's about to stand next to a bunch of innocent bystanders who don't know all those salient details... ."
1,:    Alpha's  machinations and improbable foresight drove the plot from the second episode.
1,"How the hell did he know they wouldn't shoot Echo in ""Grey Hour"" after he wiped her?"
1,"Dollhouse would find her too valuable, he was probably ready to rescue her in a pinch, and he's stark-raving mad."
1,Boyd  getting himself installed as  Echo's handler  so he could keep tabs on her.
1,"Not to mention giving permission for Sierra to be permanently imprinted and sent to Nolan and later having Adelle demoted, all to test Topher and Adelle to see if they were worthy to be among the chosen few who survive the thoughtpocalypse."
0,"Caroline, when Topher offers to give her her memories back."

1,"Juliet  It appears that   The Lockeness Monster was also  Becoming the Mask  after spending so much time in Locke form (which just goes to show how special Locke really was, since the Monster doubtless has spent at least as much time in Christian form and others, and never became the mask when imitating personalities like theirs)."
1,"This was foreshadowed more than once, perhaps for the first time when The Lockeness Monster shouts, ""Don't tell me what I can't do!"
1,DON'T TELL ME WHAT I CAN'T DO!!
1,""" And it culminates, perhaps, during the final fight with Jack, in which he hesitates for a long moment with the knife to his throat which would make this an extremely rare case of a  Killed Off for Real  character who is not returning in any literal fashion whatsoever still pulling off a sort of  Deus ex Machina  from beyond the grave."

1,"Sure enough, by the end of the episode he has the diamonds in hand."
1,"Case in point Across the Sea , the third-to-last episode, picks up a thread that had been dangling from  the first season,  namely the  skeletons in the cave."
1,"Similarly, the first scene of the pilot had a white tennis shoe dangling from one of the trees in the bamboo thicket Jack woke up."

0,The first ones being the white and black stones and the  infamous numbers .
1,"The Man in Black can lay strong claim to being the show's ultimate Grand Master of  Xanatos Speed Chess , both in terms of effectiveness and speed, after the events of ""The Candidate"" in which on extremely short notice he creates a situation that causes  six main characters to unknowingly place themselves in a death trap , and also  keeps himself clear of his own trap and makes the six think they were double-crossing him when they locked him out ."

1," Richard Alpert  skirts damn close to this in season 6, but is eventually pulled back from the edge by Hurley."
1,"Heck, the entire latter half of season 6, especially from   the sub explosion  to the last episode would probably count as this."

1,"""    Eventually  inverted  in the best way   though they might die alone, they  move on  together ."
1,"And, as of 6x16 (""What They Died For"") this was justified-  Turns out Jacob purposely picked screwed up people to bring to the island so that they'd have a reason to want to replace him, as opposed to someone who was torn from a happy life ."

1,:    Man in Black :  You are too late   He is wrong
1,And then totally inverted in the final season: the goal of the main characters becomes to stop the  Big Bad  from leaving the Island - something they have attempted themselves for so long early in the series.

1,The  Flash Sideways  world turns out to be the afterlife.
1,"Sawyer and Desmond  were the other two filmed to be in the coffin, but obviously weren't in it when the episode aired."
1,In the DVD bonus material for that season the writers said that they sweated a bit when that episode aired for fear the editor had spliced the wrong bit of footage onto the end of the episode because it would have been a bear to write their way out of.
1,"""See you in another life, brotha,"" is repeated several times, and then there are other things of the same sort like Nadia's assurance that she will see Sayid again in another life, if not this one all of these things foreshadowing   the flash-sideways ."
1,The poor guy turns out to be a pivotal  Unwitting Pawn  in the scheme of the Man in Black .

0,"With a storyline this convoluted that stretches over such a long time period, there are naturally a few in-universe examples."
0,Sometimes you wonder just how Ben could have planned for some things.
1,"Ben seems like a rookie compared to  Jacob's enemy , whose  plan  included everything in Ben's plans, plus a couple of twists which ultimately gave him the upper hand and led to  un-Locke manipulating Ben into killing Jacob."
1,"A promo implies that  the Man in Black  turned from a misled young man just trying to get home into  The  Monster  because he went insane after spending  2,000 years  trapped on the island."
1," While he's not exactly stealing other peoples' bodies, the  Man in Black /Smoke Monster is able to assume the form of anyone who has previously died whose body is on the Island such as Alex, Yemi, Christian, and Locke."

1,The things his followers do in his name range from morally questionable to evil.
1,"Widmore, undoubtedly the man behind the ""purge"" of the Dharma Initiative, is unapologetically evil, and was the leader of the Island for many years before Ben staged a coup."
1,"It does remain unclear how many of these acts Jacob approved of, and which were the result of people being tempted by selfishness and their baser nature (or possibly under the influence of the MIB)."
