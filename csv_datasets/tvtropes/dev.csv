1,"You're trapped in your body for several weeks after 'death,' until it decays enough that it simply can't sustain your soul any more, during which time it can't recover from any injuries you sustain, and  you can feel yourself decomposing on the inside."
1,"Herrick tends to act like this, as well as several of the other vampires and  Kirby  in Series 4."

1," Mitchell, in the Series 3 finale, begs George to stake him ."
1,Subverted by Cutler towards   Hal  - he's kind of bipolar on the hate issue there.

1,"Several long-delayed ones from Cutler to Hal, after   Hal's past attempts to turn Cutler evil turn out to have  Gone Horribly Right ."

0,"The whole of  S 04 E 01  seems to be made of this, to the extent where you don't know if you're laughing or crying."
1,"  George killing Herrick  may have resolved one problem but as it turns out in series 2 the repercussions involve    a power vacuum in the vampire lot , the loss of a system which kept the supernatural existence under wraps, and George becoming notorious enough to be targeted by vampires loyal to Herrick."
1,"Though things are tentatively getting better... wait... Nope, actually  it's getting back to worse ."
1,"Annie staking the vampire who was going to silence by turning   Nancy, who'd discovered proof that Mitchell murdered the Box Tunnel 20  was arguably done with the best intentions."
1,"However it then leads to   Nancy getting Mitchell arrested and the whole masquerade of the supernatural existing is about to break , and even worse,   Herrick wiped out the remaining police in the house and he got his memory back ."
